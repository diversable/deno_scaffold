# deno_scaffold

A quick way to set up a Deno project with some "best practices" described in the Deno manual (eg. https://deno.land/manual/linking_to_external_code and https://deno.land/manual/linking_to_external_code/integrity_checking)

Open to pull requests which will make this starter template easier to use - anything that helps you get up and running quickly without regard to the type of project being implemented (CLI, web server, etc).
