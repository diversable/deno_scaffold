# Deno Scaffold

This repo is intended as a quick way to set up a [Deno](https://deno.land/) project with some "best practices" described in the Deno manual.

--- NB: This repo is open to pull requests which will make this starter template easier to use - anything that helps you get up and running quickly without regard to the type of project being implemented (CLI, web server, etc) ---

Note: If you haven't yet installed Deno on your machine, see the installation instructions at the bottom of this document, or go read up on Deno here:

Deno Manual: https://deno.land/manual/introduction

## "Best Practices" - from the [Deno Manual](https://deno.land/manual/introduction)

### The `./src/deps.ts` file: Working with ES Module Dependencies Easily

For reference, read the Deno Manual's section on ["Linking to External Code"](https://deno.land/manual/linking_to_external_code):

The Deno manual recommends creating a `./src/deps.ts` file to store your project's dependencies in. In this scaffold, the full suite of Deno's native testing utilities have been re-exported from deps.ts to allow quick access in your own test files.
Just import them in your test files like this:
```js
// in *.test.ts or *.test.js, using ES modules style syntax...
import { assertEquals, runTests, test } from "./deps.ts";

assertEquals("hello", "hello");
assertEquals("world", "world");

console.log("I asserted correctly! ðŸŽ‰");

// your test code

```

NOTE: Deno recommends versioning your imports so that your projects don't unexpectedly break if you need to re-load your code. For example, note the version number in the following URL import from Deno's standard library:
```js
import { Response } from "https://deno.land/std@0.53.0/http/server.ts";
```
**Note**: In this repo, the export in `deps.ts` is not versioned so that this template doesn't continually become outdated as updates are made to Deno. 
In general, though, following the advice to version your imports/re-exports will make your life easier :)

### Caching dependencies locally

A `./deno_dir` folder has been added in which you can cache your dependencies locally (rather than in the global, default deno cache, which differs depending on your OS). 

To download remote dependencies & update the dependency cache, type the following command into your terminal:
```bash
DENO_DIR=./deno_dir deno cache src/deps.ts
```

This will also help others collaborate on your projects with you :)
For more info, see the [Deno Manual's notes on dependency caching](https://deno.land/manual/linking_to_external_code)

### Integrity checking & lock files

There is a `lock.json` file included at the root of this repo, similar to a lock file you would find in a node.js project.

In Deno, the lock file is not automatically generated (at this point in Deno's development, anyway). 

However, you can create/update a lock file any time you choose using the following command:
```bash
# Create/update the lock file "lock.json".
deno cache --lock=lock.json --lock-write src/deps.ts
```
For more info, refer to the Deno Manual's section on ["Integrity Checking and Lock Files"](https://deno.land/manual/linking_to_external_code/integrity_checking).

To run your code, **remember that Deno is a secure runtime**; you need to explicitly enable permissions to allow things like network & file access. 

The available permissions are:

#### Permissions list

- Allow all permissions. This disables all security.

`-A, --allow-all`

- Allow environment access for things like getting and setting of environment variables.

`--allow-env`

- Allow high resolution time measurement. High resolution time can be used in timing attacks and fingerprinting.

`--allow-hrtime `

- Allow network access. You can specify an optional, comma separated list of domains to provide a whitelist of allowed domains.

`--allow-net=\<allow-net> `

- Allow loading plugins. Please note that --allow-plugin is an unstable feature.

`--allow-plugin`

- Allow file system read access. You can specify an optional, comma separated list of directories or files to provide a whitelist of allowed file system access.

`--allow-read=\<allow-read>`

- Allow running subprocesses. Be aware that subprocesses are not run in a sandbox and therefore do not have the same security restrictions as the deno process. Therefore, use with caution.

`--allow-run`

- Allow file system write access. You can specify an optional, comma separated list of directories or files to provide a whitelist of allowed file system access.

`--allow-write=\<allow-write> `


The syntax to run a Deno program which allows read access *to the entire filesystem* is:
```bash
deno run --allow-read ./src/main.ts
```

To restrict the permissions to a particular directory, use:
```bash
deno run --allow-read="./src" ./src/main.ts
```
